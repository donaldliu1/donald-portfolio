                    <p> Outside of my career I love anime, gaming and gym, currently playing Old School Runescape, Genshin Impact and League of Legends. I&#39;ve been watching anime since the days of multi-part episodes on Youtube with my favourite being Code Geass, Vinland Saga and Attack on Titan. I enjoy working out and pushing myself. Combining the three I&#39;ve started a passion project where I reward my gym sessions with simulated Pok√©mon card gacha pulls. Away from the computer screen I love rock climbing, currently only indoor!</p>
